# Heritage-Walks

This project is an admin portal for the Heritage Walks project here: https://github.com/AllenWorker/HertiageWalks-XamarinForm The application allows for users to use it in place of a tour guide as they follow a given heritage walk.

This portal allows for the administrator of the Heritage Walks system to modify what trails, stops and other data is available from within the application. This portal utilises Laravel (a PHP framework) to provide easy setup and allow for quick deployment on to a PHP supported web server. 

This portal was developed using both Laravel (a PHP framework) and Laragon (an all in one web/database setup for Windows).
