This project is an admin portal for an upcoming mobile application, that will allow for users to use as a tour guide to see where certain locations are and get information on these locations.

This portal allows for the admininstrator of the system to be able to add, update, delete and read from a database.

Developed using Laravel (a PHP framework) and Laragon (an all in one web/database setup for Windows).
